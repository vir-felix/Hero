# Coupon Codes

Coupons are small codes (e.g, "NIFTY123", "WINTERSALE", "JFO43K") that can be entered during checkout to grant some sort if discount to your customers.  They are an excellent promotional tool and one of many ways Hero helps you sell your products.

There are three types of discounts given by coupons:

* *Price Reduction*
* *Free Trial on Subscriptions*
* *Free Shipping*

A coupon code can only do one of the above, and coupon codes cannot be combined.

Coupon codes are managed at *Storefront > Coupons* in the control panel.

## Creating Coupon Codes

After specifying the type of coupon you are creating, you only need to enter the *Name* and *Code* for the coupon.

Optionally, you can also specify the following:

* *Maximum Uses* - Limit the coupon to being used X times.  Afterwards, it expires.
* *Maximum Uses per Customer* - Same as above, except it will only expire for that particular user.
* *Start Date* - When should the coupon become available?
* *End Date* - When should it stop being available?
* *Subscriptions* - If this coupon affects subscriptions, you can specify which subscription plans it is valid for.
* *Products* - If this coupon affects products, you can specify which products it is valid for.
* *Minimum Cart Value* - Some free shipping coupons require a minimum cart value before they are able to be used.  Specify this here.

## Notes

* Coupons can never be deleted, but they can be deactivated at any time.  After that, they simply remain in the system for records purposes.
* If you do not use coupons, the promotional code box will not show during checkout when using a default theme.
* If a coupon code is entered, users will receive immediate feedback as to the validity of their coupon code.
* Coupon codes cannot be used together.  Enter another coupon code will reset the original prices/shipping costs.
