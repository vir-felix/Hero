# Search

Hero includes a powerful site-wide search function that can perform a keyword search on all of your content and your products.

To configure the search function, go to *Configuration > Search* in your control panel.

## Specifying Searchable Content

You may not want the user to be able to search all of your site's *content*.  In the Search configuration manager, you can check off which content you would like to be searchable and uncheck that content types you do not.

You can also specify whether you would like store *products* to be searched.

For each searchable content type, you can specify the "Summary" field to be available when displaying search results.  If you had a "News Articles" content type, this might be "Article Body".  If you had a "Movies" content type, this might be "Plot Summary".

## Other Settings

* *Summary Length* - If you are using summary fields for your content that are variable in length, you will likely want to trim these fields to a reasonable length for displaying in a list of search results.  By default, this is "300" characters.  This can be easily changed, though.
* *Wait Time* - Specify the minimum number of seconds between one user's searches.  This can lower the strain on your server or limit attempts to abuse your site with a massive amount of searches that use up your web server's resources.
