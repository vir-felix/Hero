# Settings

Many facets of Hero are customizable simply by tweaking the settings at *Configuration > Settings* in the control panel.

Each customizable setting is listed on this page under five categories:

* Core
* Design
* E-commerce
* Members
* Publishing

To edit any setting, simply press "edit" for editable settings or "toggle" to turn a setting On/Off.  When you are finished modifying a setting, be sure to press "save" to make the changes permanent.

## Important Settings

When you first setup Hero, there are a few settings which you'll likely want to tweak immediately:

* *email_name* - The name in the "From" header of each email.  This will likely be your name or your website's name.
* *site_email* - This email will also appear in the "From" header of each email, and will be where any replies to automated system emails go.
* *email_signature* - This signature is, by default, attached to each outgoing system email.  Note that, if you [modify the global email template](/docs/configuration/emails.md), this setting may be ignored.
* *site_name* - The name of your website.  By default, this will appear in the `<title>` of themes and in emails.
* *currency_symbol* - If you are not using a currency denoted by "$", you can customize this prefix here.
* *weight_unit* - If you will be selling products and want to list their weight in a unit other than "kg", modify this setting.

There are many other ways to configure Hero, but tweaking these will definitely get you started.  Next, you may want to setup your [payment gateway](/docs/configuration/payment_gateways.md) or [customize all outgoing emails](/docs/configuration/emails.md).
