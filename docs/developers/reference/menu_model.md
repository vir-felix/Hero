# Menu Model

Menus are managed at *Layout > Menu Manager*.  This model, however, allows you to programmatically modify menus, clear the menu cache, etc.

Menus are cached to reduce the number of database queries per page load.  Menu data is stored in cache files automatically.

## Initialization

```
$this->load->model('menu_manager/menu_model');
// methods: $this->menu_model->new_menu(), etc.
```

## Method Reference

[method]void clear_cache ()[/method]

Clear the menu cache files.  This should be called whenever a menu or link is modified.

[method]int new_menu (string $name)[/method]

Create a new menu.

[method]int add_link (int $menu_id , int $parent_link , string $type , int $link_id , string $text [, string $special_type = FALSE [, string $external_url = FALSE [, array $privileges = array()]]])[/method]

Add a link to a menu.  "Special" links have some magic in that they may generate multiple menu items, or dynamically modify their menu items, depending on other factors.  The following are special links:

* *home* - Always links to the frontpage
* *control_panel* - Always links to the control panel
* *my_account* - Will generate links differently depending on logged in/out status.  May generate 2nd tier links if you are logged in, for account management.
* *store* - Link to the store and store collections in the 2nd tier.
* *search* - Links to your search page.
* *subscriptions* - Links to your subscription listings page.
* *cart* - Links to your cart.
