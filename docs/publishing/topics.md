# Topics

Content topics are a way to categorize and organize your published content.

They are very simple and consist only of a *name* and *description* (optional).  Topics also provide an easy way for designers to [retrieve specific content from within a template](/docs/designers/reference/publish.md).

Topics can be organized hierarchically, with an unlimited number of "levels" or child topics.

## Display Topics

If you are customizing your theme and looking to incorporate a list of your site's topics, [you should use the {topics} tag to dynamically load topics](/docs/designers/reference/publish.md).

You can also display content based on its being or not being in a topic.  For that, use the [{content} tag in your templates](/docs/designers/reference/publish.md).
